You can install the stable version of DesModder [directly from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/desmodder-for-desmos/eclmfdfimjhkmjglgdldedokjaemjfjp). DesModder is currently only supported for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers such as Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.

The extension updates every few weeks (see DesModder releases page for a history).

If you want to get new features early, follow the instructions in https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/wiki/Development#Setup, keeping in mind these it may not always work at all times.
