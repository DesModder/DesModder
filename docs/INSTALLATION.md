### Web Store

This is reccommended as the extension will auto-update this way.

You can install the stable version of DesModder [directly from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/desmodder-for-desmos/eclmfdfimjhkmjglgdldedokjaemjfjp) or [from the Firefox Web Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/desmodder-for-desmos/).

DesModder is currently only supported for Google Chrome, Chromium-based browsers such as Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi, and Firefox (or Firefox based browsers).

The extension updates every few weeks (see DesModder releases page for a history).

### Latest

Sometimes the chrome web store takes a few days to approve new extension releases, where hotfixes that have yet to be applied might cause Desmos to not load.

**Chrome**: Go to [Releases](https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/releases), download the latest dist-chrome.zip and unzip the file. Then go to `chrome://extensions` in the browser address bar, and enable Developer Mode. Select load unpacked, find and select your unzipped folder of the extension, and click open.

**Firefox**: Go to [Releases](https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/releases), download the latest dist-ff.zip. Then go to `about:addons` in the browser address bar. Click the cogwheel to the right of Manage Your Extensions, find and select dist-ff.zip, and click open.

### Git Version

If you want to get new features even earlier, follow the instructions in https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/wiki/Development#Setup, keeping in mind these may not always work at all times.
