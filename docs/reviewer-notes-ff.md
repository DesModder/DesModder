The extension can be built with any relatively recent version of node and npm.
I built this with node v16.7.0 and npm 7.20.3 on Ubuntu 20.04, though
collaborators have built it on Windows.

Build process:

```
npm install
npm run build-ff
```

Then the `dist` directory will contain the distributed code.
