GLesmos Roadmap 2023, proposed by Fasteroid.

Required:

    Outlines:
        Fix whole screen filling when no outlines are visible [x]
        Don't run the shader if they're disabled              [x]
        Increase width and opacity on equation selected       [ ]

    Fill:
        Implement                             [x]
        Increase opacity on equation selected [ ]


Desired:

    General Performance:
        Use less division in the fragment shaders  [ ]
        Use uniforms for colors, alpha, and width  [ ]

    Outlines:
        Investigate blobby lines bug [ ]
        FIX blobby lines bug         [ ]


Future:

    Implement integrals [ ]

    Optimize sliders by passing values via uniforms [ ]

    GLesmos polygon renderer [ ]
