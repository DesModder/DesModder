/**
 * Physics Lab against a real Desmos.
 *
 * Two things here cannot be checked anywhere else. The exact-constant
 * arithmetic is unit-tested, but nothing offline can prove that what it emits
 * is LaTeX Desmos parses — `\pi` written beside `e` is `\pie`, an undefined
 * command that renders as nothing, and every unit assertion was happy with it.
 * And a slope field is a picture: the marks can be the right length, the right
 * count and the right colour while pointing the wrong way, and no assertion
 * about the config would notice.
