All graphs created using this extension are compatible with vanilla Desmos. This means your graphs are always safe to share with others, regardless of whether or not they have DesModder.

- One small exception: expressions rendered using GLesmos may be much slower for people without the feature.

Chrome will warn you asking for permission for the declarativeNetRequest API ("Block content on any page you visit"). In this case, the warning is inaccurate because the net request rules apply [only to Desmos](https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/blob/main/public/chrome/net_request_rules.json) and simply modify response headers to provide permissions that enable in-browser video export. This extension follows Chrome's best practices and is open source (https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder), so you and others can contribute and see what goes on in the background.

Keep in mind that many features of this extension rely on unofficial, undocumented, or unstable parts of Desmos. When something stops working, report it on http://github.com/DesModder/DesModder/issues with a description of the issue.

Currently only works on the public-facing calculator at https://desmos.com/calculator.
